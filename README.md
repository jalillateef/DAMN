#DAMN

Damn is a website where you can search your favorite artists and find their discography, view upcoming concerts and live music events, and get information such as a biography.

#USAGE

Once you are on the home page (damnmusicapp.netlify.app), type in your favorite artist in the search bar. From the search results page, select which artist you wish to see more information on, or save that artist to your favorites page for easy access later. The 'more info' selection will allow you to see the biography, discography, upcoming events, birthday, and hometown of the chosen artist.
